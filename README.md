# School

This project was made in pairs and was part of our learning in Codaisseur.
It was wrote in Ruby on Rails.

This program allows to the admin: see the list of students, the pairs of students for today and the future pairs. Beyond this, the admin can change the status of admin and students in the List of Users.

The students can see their pair for today and the past pairs.
